# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. By using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, the model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and pneumonia-affected lungs, offering a potential tool for aiding medical diagnosis.
